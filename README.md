# Flutter Template Project Summary

This project provides a scalable starting point for Flutter app development, following best practices for folder structure and organization.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Folder Structure**: Includes all recommended directories for scalable Flutter apps:
	- `core/`: Core utilities and base classes
	- `features/`: Feature modules and business logic
	- `home/`: Home page and related components
	- `widgets/`: Reusable UI widgets
	- `data/`: Data models, repositories, and sources
	- `services/`: API, local storage, and other services
	- `utils/`: Utility and helper functions
	- `constants/`: App-wide constants (strings, colors, etc.)
	- `theme/`: Theme and style definitions
	- `routes/`: Route management and navigation
	- `generated/`: Generated files (e.g., localization)

- **Ready for Customization**: Easily add new features, services, and widgets as your app grows.

- **Separation of Concerns**: Promotes clean code and maintainability by organizing files by responsibility.

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:  
	 ```sh
	 flutter pub get
	 ```
2. Start development in the appropriate folder (e.g., add features in `features/`, widgets in `widgets/`).

### Recommended Practices

- Keep business logic separate from UI code.
- Use the provided folders to organize code for scalability.
- Add documentation and comments for clarity.
